# robot-arm (OLD)
(OLD) Mechanically designed, with the aid of CAD and 3D printing, a robotic arm with some basic programming to control it.

6ButtonArm: Arduino code for controlling the arm movements with a 6 button controller.

Independant Project Robotic Arm: School presentation for my robotic arm project.
Note: The school year unfortunatly ended before the completion of this project. While I mostly finished the mechanical aspect of the project, I was mostly limited to purely research done on object recognition. As I was just a sophomore in highschool at the time, I probably would have settled for something similar to the object recogniton used in my Soccer Bot project (which was completely implemented).
